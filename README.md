This is a mirror of my current engine project. It won't compile because it's missing all the third-party dependencies and tools (to avoid legal issues). 

It's missing a lot of normal subsystems because I wanted to focus on building up the core foundations first and testing them early-on to learn more about various testing methods.

The code is a bit of a mess because it's still very experimental.
